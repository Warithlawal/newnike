			<h2>NIKE TERMS AND CONDITION</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				Keeping the product testing a secret is often part of the agreement to maintain the integrity of the testing process and prevent any leaks of confidential information about the products being tested. It helps Nike control the release of new products and surprises for their customers. If you're selected for product testing, remember to keep it hush-hush until Nike gives the green light to share the information!
			</p>
			<p>
				The terms and conditions for Nike product testing usually outline things like confidentiality agreements, feedback requirements, and sometimes compensation details. It's important to carefully read through them to understand what's expected of you as a tester. If you have any specific questions about the terms and conditions, feel free to ask the coordinator assigned to you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nike collects feedback through various channels like surveys, focus groups, and direct communication with product testers. They value your input to make their products better for all customers. It's a great way to have your voice heard and influence the products you love!
